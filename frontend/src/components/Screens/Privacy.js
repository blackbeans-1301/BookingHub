            momondo maintains commercially-reasonable technical, administrative,
            and physical security measures designed to protect your information
            from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
            destruction.

            When your payment information is being transmitted to our Services
            or through our Services, it will be protected by cryptographic
            protocols. To be clear, momondo only stores your payment information
            if you choose to save that information to your account. When you
            submit a booking or reservation, we transfer your payment
            information to the applicable travel partner to process the
            transaction. Our contracts with third parties that receive your
            payment information require them to keep it secure and confidential.

            measures taken by momondo or our third-party service providers.
            Except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded or limited
            due to applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for

            unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.
            You play an important role in keeping your information secure. You
            should not share your user name, password, or other security
            information for your momondo account with anyone. If we receive
